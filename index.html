				In December of 1969, a man named Greg Noll rode the biggest wave ever surfed. It happened in Hawaii, at a place called Makaha, and there was no doubt about the magnitude of his achievement; it surpassed all that had come before.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most stunning of all was Noll's reaction. He was a legend in the sport, a larger-than-life character who had ridden giant waves for years, and he suddenly retired at the age of 31. That was his swan song. For those devoted to the sport and its lifelong benefits, it was difficult to fathom how Noll could simply <a class="classic-link" href ="http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/World-record-surfer-a-prisoner-of-his-talent-5024902.php">walk away.</a>
			</p>

			<div class="content-emphatic-callout">
				<span>WHOA, THAT'S RADICAL!</span>
			</div>
			<p>
				And yet, big-wave surfing is the essence of his being. He's not in the sport to show off or impress anyone. He's really good at it, and when confronted with the ultimate test - a veritable <a class="classic-link" href="http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/World-record-surfer-a-prisoner-of-his-talent-5024902.php">(oceanic) avalanche.</a> heading his way, with an opportunity to whip his board around and ride that thing - he will go.
			</p>
			<p>	
				You just can't find that type of thrill at the dry cleaners. Even an everyday surf session, the kind many would cherish for weeks, leaves Dollar unfulfilled. His life seems perfectly in order: college degree (Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo), steady job (Northern California rep for Reef footwear), wonderful family. But he has reached the heights of big-wave experience, and he finds the aftermath a disturbing mix of pride and exasperation.

					What's it like to stare down a 78-foot wave? It's really no big deal. Or so big-wave legend Garrett McNamara claims. I got desensitized by riding so many Big Waves that I don't really get a rush anymore, McNamara said with a laugh.
